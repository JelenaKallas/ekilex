new classifiers are to be added to classifier-main-map.csv, classifier-main-value.csv, classifier-domain.csv files from which classifier-main.sql, classifier-domain.sql are generated.
do not add classifiers directly to classifier-main.sql, classifier-domain.sql !
there are few classifiers that are not under classifiers management control: lang, label_type, dataset. those are managed in the file classifier-manual.sql
